                <p>Ever since I started coding some years ago, I always liked the idea
                of games whose levels were different every time. Yes, the advantage
                of using formulas to create levels is it gives players a different
                experience each time they play the game. This article runs through the generation of
                <a class = normal href = /articles/my_very_first_game target = _blank>pretty much</a>
                my first attempt on generating levels with code. Hope you enjoy!</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Set up</h3>
                <p>To begin the level generation, we need to start by making a list
                that stores the current level. We can do this by constructing an array.</p>

<pre class = code>this.array = [] // an array that stores the level
this.width = 100 // the amount of columns
this.height = 100 // the amount of rows
</pre>

                <p>The first thing to do to our array is to completely fill it
                with blocks, which we can mine out later. In the code
                snippet below, a "block"
                is represented by <span class = snip>1</span>.</p>

<pre class = code>// iterate through the amount of blocks in the world
for (let i = 0; i < this.width * this.height; i ++) {
    this.array.push(1) // fill the level with blocks
}
</pre>

                <p>To draw the blocks, you can write code similar to this:</p>

<pre class = code>// set the scale
const block_size = 50

// iterate through every square in the level
for (let x = 0; x < this.width; x ++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < this.height; y ++) {
        const block = this.array[x + y * this.width]

        // draw it if the current square is a block
        if (block == 1)
            ctx.fillRect(x * block_size, y * block_size, block_size, block_size)
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>That's all you need to set up the map. Now we can start carving bits away!</p>
            </div>

            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/procedural_room_generation_snakes_and_ladders/2.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Chambers</h3>

                <p>The next stage is to start mining rooms. Each chamber
                has a random width and height, and is positioned in a grid.
                Store the chambers in an array, so that the computer can know
                where to place the tunnels and actors later on.</p>

<pre class = code>¬this.array = []¬
this.chambers = [] // make an array that stores the chambers
¬this.width = 100
this.height = 100¬</pre>


                <p>In the code below, <span class = snip>0</span> refers to plain air.</p>

<pre class = code>// this code makes a single chamber.
// note that chamber x, y, width and height have already been defined.

for (let x = chamber_x; x < chamber_x + chamber_width; x ++) {
    for (let y = chamber_y; y < chamber_y + chamber_height; y ++) {
        this.array[x + y * this.width] = 0
    }
}</pre></div>

                <h3>Tunnels</h3>

                <p>Making the tunnels is a tricky part, so I will just give you a
                simplified overview. To begin, we need to know how each chamber
                should be connected. I went for the Binary Tree maze algorithm,
                which - in case you're wondering - is the simplest
                procedural maze ever. This is how it works:</p>

                <div class = subDemo>
                    ∙ Get your chambers set up<br>
                    ∙ Starting at the top left corner, connect your chamber to either:<br>
                    &emsp; ∙ The chamber on the right<br>
                    &emsp; ∙ The chamber underneath
                </div>

                <p>With these rules applied, the maze should start to be taking shape.
                Note how the passages seem to point towards the bottom right corner:</p>
            </div>

            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/procedural_room_generation_snakes_and_ladders/4.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <p>You may notice a problem.
                The thing is, if we just stop here, some channels may never connect.
                The way to fix this is to cut a long channel through the right and
                bottom edge, and that solves the problem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/procedural_room_generation_snakes_and_ladders/5.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Ladders</h3>
                <p>The next thing to add is ladders. This took a very long time for me to
                get right, but in the end the solution turned out to be really simple:
                Let's say a chamber decides to connect itself to the one beneath
                it. To help me explain, let's call the first chamber Jeff and the second
                chamber Andrew.</p>

                <p>A tunnel emerges from the base of Jeff and snakes its way down. At the moment,
                the tunnel stops as soon as it touches Andrew's head, but let's
                change that rule. Let's make it so that the tunnel has to proceed
                through Andrew's body untill it reaches the ground. This may sound
                pointless, as the tunnel would just be mining through plain air,
                but it means that we are able to start building a ladder.</p>

                <p>Let's add a new rule: If the tunnel finds itself mining though Andrew's
                body, add a ladder block behind it. This new rule means that ladders will
                only be generated inside chambers and it also means that Drillo will be
                able to get into rooms that he couldn't before.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/procedural_room_generation_snakes_and_ladders/6.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Reverse generation</h3>

                <p>As you can see, the world still looks very different from the real game.
                What we are missing is <b>reverse generation</b> - a final "filter"
                that removes the pointless blocks. At the end of the generation code,
                I run through every block in the level and do the following:</p>

                <div class = subDemo>
                    ∙ If the current block is surrounded by other blocks:<br>
                    &emsp;∙ Turn the current block into thin air
                </div>

                <p>The advantage of this final filter is it speeds up in-game performance, it makes
                the level look better (in my opinion), and it also gives the world a vast feeling
                of nothingness - meaning the player is not able to see the sharp boundaries of the
                map.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/procedural_room_generation_snakes_and_ladders/7.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Side effects</h3>

                <p>This final section briefly discusses how each side effect is placed in the level
                and how the level adapts to them. To set everything up, put a side effect in each
                chamber, making sure that it does't get dropped above a tunnel hole.</p>

                <p>If you played the game, you may have noticed the average size of each chamber
                grew as the game went on. This is because the size for each side effect is stored
                from the start. It means that the computer can know exactly how big its chambers
                should be for the current level.</p>

                <p>In the game, there's a function called <span class = snip>getLevelEffects()</span>,
                which returns an array of all the enemy types for the level.</p>

<div class = code>function getLevelEffects() {
    if (game.level <= 2) return [0]
    if (game.level <= 3) return [1, 1, 0]
    if (game.level <= 6) return [2, 2, 1, 0]
    if (game.level <= 7) return [3, 2, 1]
    if (game.level <= 8) return [4, 2, 0]
    if (game.level <= 9) return [6, 4, 1]
    if (game.level <= 10) return [7, 6, 2]
    if (game.level <= 11) return [7, 6, 4]
}
</div>

                <p>You may notice that the largest side effects always come first in the array.
                The reason for this is it means that when the map is being generated,
                it can take the size of the biggest side effect into consideration.
                It can thus make sure that its minimum chamber width and height is way larger
                than the recorded enemy.</p>

<div class = code>// get the biggest enemy sizes
const EFFECT = EFFECT_TYPES[getLevelEffects()[0]]

// minimum chamber width
const MIN_WIDTH = Math.ceil(EFFECT.width.max) * 2

// minimum chamber height
const MIN_HEIGHT = Math.ceil(EFFECT.height.max)

// result
const CHAMBER_W = {min: MIN_WIDTH + 1, max: MIN_WIDTH + 10}
const CHAMBER_H = {min: MIN_HEIGHT + 3, max: MIN_HEIGHT + 5}

                and maybe it will come in handy for projects in the months to come!</p>
