            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/ios_mission_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/1.png></div>

            <span class = gap>
                Hello everyone! This article talks about some of the pointless
                details I added to the game
                <a class = normal href = /content/ios_mission>Io's Mission</a>.
                I've only picked the best ones, so it's not too long.
                The subjects are listed in no particular order.
            </span>
            <span class = gap>
                <h2>DETAIL 01</h2>
                For some reason, I decided it was very important to make sure the crabs
                (the ones in the beach level) walked properly. Did you notice that
                they moved up and down slightly as the crawled along the sand?
                <p></p>
                The difference is only a few pixels in the real game. I've scaled
                the crab up a bit so you can see this "walking up and down" more clearly,
                but I've also put a normal one next to it so you can see the comparison.
                Note that in its normal state, the vertical movement is unnoticable.
                Unless you have very good eyes.
            </span>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/ios_mission_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/3.html></div>
            <span class = gap>
                <h2>DETAIL 02</h2>
                Another pointless detail is the scanlines. If you want
                a technical definition for them, go and look it up, but for the sake of
                simplicity, scanlines are just horizontal transparent bars stretching
                from one side of the screen to the other. Did you notice them?
                You probably did.
                <p></p>
                The part I don't expect you to have noticed was the fact that these
                "scanlines" change strength in different parts of the screen.
                In the image below, I've exaggerated these weights 100x to help you see
                them better.
            </span>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/ios_mission_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/4.png></div>
            <span class = gap>
                Pointless, if you ak me. However, we must also remember that - as my father
                used to say - "it's all in the details." The invisible weights on
                these scanlines are certainly crucial to the gameplay of Io's Mission.
                I can't imagine what it would look like without them.
            </span>
            <span class = gap>
                <h2>DETAIL 03</h2>
                A whole week was spent on the crocodiles. The first day was taken
                up with deciding on the main colours and shapes, another two days
                were taken up with getting the movement right (like sinking and
                attacking).
                <p></p>
                In the remaining four days I created the legs and the
                tail. Trouble is, you hardly EVER see either of those things in
                the real game. Perhaps an occasional flick from the swamp, or the
                legs are revealed for an instant when he jumps, but aside from
                that these parts are practically invisible.
            </span>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/ios_mission_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/5.png></div>
            <span class = gap>
                Important note: for those who have exceptionally good eyes
                you actually <i>will</i> be able to see the whole crocodile during the
                game. The swamp is set to only 96% opacity, so you can see through in theory.
                I can't, by the way.
            </span>

            <span class = gap>
                <h2>THE SMALLER DETAILS</h2>
                I could go on for ages if I wanted to. Did you notice that Io breathed?
                Or that, when he transitioned, he used a bezier movement instead
                of linear? Did you notice that the grass and seaweed swayed in
                the breeze? Or did you even notice that the water was very, very,
                slightly transparent? Did you notice the lights flashed on the
                machines? Or that Drillo's friend was constantly walking?
                <p></p>
                I've officially spent far too much time on pointless details.
                Does it really add anything to
                <a class = normal href = /content/ios_mission>Io's Mission</a>?
                That's up to you. But for now I'm tired of writing articles and
                making games.
                <p></p>
                See you next time!
