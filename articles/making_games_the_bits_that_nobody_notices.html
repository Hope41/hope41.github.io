            <h1>Making games: The Bits That Nobody Notices</h1>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/making_games_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/1.png></div>

            <div class = demo>
                <p>One of the most improtant parts of game development is having
                an attention to detail. This - as with most things - has the potential
                to go too far, and adding details may become an obsession.</p>

                <p>It's always worth considering (and I'm not saying I did this, by the way)
                the "focus" of your project from early on;
                knowing what elements to prioritise will help you make the most
                of the computer's processing power.
                After all, even with today's technology, there are still limitations
                to what a computer can handle.</p>

                <p>This article talks about some of the (pointless?) details I
                added to the game <a class = normal href = /content/ios_mission>Io's Mission</a>.
                I've only picked the best ones, so it's not too long.
                The subjects that follow are listed in no particular order.
            </div>
            <div class = demo>
                <h2>DETAIL 01</h2>
                <p>For some reason, it seemed very important to make sure the crabs
                (the ones in the beach level) walked properly. Did you notice that
                they moved up and down slightly as they crawled along the sand?</p>

                <p>The difference is only a few pixels in the real game. I've scaled
                the crab up a bit so you can see this "walking up and down" more clearly,
                but I've also put a normal one next to it so you can see the comparison.
                Note that in its normal state, the vertical movement is unnoticable.
                Unless you have very good eyes.</p>
            </div>
            <iframe src = /articles/extra/making_games_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/3.html></iframe>
            <div class = demo>
                <h2>DETAIL 02</h2>
                <p>Another detail I thought I'd mention is the scanlines. If you want
                a technical definition for them, go and look it up, but for the sake of
                simplicity, scanlines are just horizontal transparent bars stretching
                from one side of the screen to the other. Did you notice them?
                You probably did.</p>

                <p>The part I don't expect you to have noticed was the fact that these
                "scanlines" change strength in different parts of the screen.
                In the image below, I've exaggerated these weights 100x to help you see
                them better.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/making_games_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/4.png></div>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>Pointless, if you ak me. However, we must also remember that - as my father
                used to say - "it's all in the details." When you think about it,
                you realise that these invisible weights on the scanlines are
                crucial - crucial! - to the gameplay of Io's Mission.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = demo>
                <h2>DETAIL 03</h2>
                <p>A whole week was spent on the crocodiles. The first day was taken
                up with deciding on the main colours and shapes, and another two days
                were taken up with getting the movement right (like sinking and
                attacking).</p>

                <p>In the remaining four days I created the legs and the
                tail. Trouble is, you hardly EVER see either of those things in
                the real game. Perhaps you may see the tail for a fleeting moment as
                ths crocodile splashes towards you, or the legs are revealed for an
                instant when he jumps, but aside from that these parts are practically invisible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /articles/extra/making_games_the_bits_that_nobody_notices/5.png></div>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>Important note: for those who have exceptionally good eyes
                you actually <i>will</i> be able to see the whole crocodile during the
                game. The swamp is set to only 96% opacity, so you can see through in theory.
                I can't, by the way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h2>THE SMALLER DETAILS</h2>
                <p>This article could be much longer, but thank goodness,
                the rest has been conveniently bunched into a single paragraph.</p>

                <p>Did you notice that Io breathed? Or that, when he transitioned,
                he used a bezier movement instead of linear? (You probably did,
                now I think of it. No doubt, as soon as your gaze fell upon him
                you said to yourself:
                "Ah, how glad I am he used bezier movement and not linear for his
                inverse kinematics...")
                Did you notice that the grass and seaweed swayed in
                the breeze? Or did you even notice that the water was very, very,
                slightly transparent? Did you notice the lights flashed on the
                machines? Or that Drillo's friend was constantly walking?</p>

                <p>I've officially spent far too much time on pointless details.
                Does it really add anything to
                <a class = normal href = /content/ios_mission>Io's Mission</a>?
                That's up to you. But for now I'm tired of writing articles and
                making games.</p>

                <p>See you next time!</p>
