            <h1>Snakes And Ladders Talk Through - Side Effects</h1>
            <div class = image source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/1.png></div>
            <p></p>
            This article runs through how the side effects (enemies) of
            <a href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a>
            are animated and rendered. Each simplified demo has its source code underneath, so feel free to have a look.
            Pay particular attention to the code inside the <span class = snip>enemy()</span> function, which handles
            the drawing and animation.
            <p></p>
            Almost every enemy uses a very similar walking pattern that you may recognise from
            <a href = /content/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds.html target = _blank>Anthrophobia</a>.
            In case you haven't already seen it, this "walking pattern" is based on a circle with
            a limit at its base:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /content/extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Worm-like Stick Thingy</h3>
            Even the first side effect uses this circular walking pattern. Notice how each of its bones move:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/1.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/1.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Centipede</h3>
            This side effect is very similar to the former one, only its body is extended upwards so that its legs move instead.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/2.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/2.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Creeper</h3>
            I'm sure you can figure out what's going on here.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/3.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/3.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Wolfish Side Effect</h3>
            As you may have already noticed, this enemy also uses the walking motion mentioned earlier.
            Its four feet are divided into two pairs at the moment, but here's a challenge: If you paste the code below
            into a new <span class = snip>.html</span> file, can you give the enemy four pairs of legs? (Tip: have a look in
            the <span class = snip>enemy()</span> function)
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/4.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/4.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Monster</h3>
            In this simplified example, the enemy is very similar to the last. In the real game, however, it occasionally spits
            out cubes - shown in the next example - and jumps whenever Drillo runs underneath it.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/5.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/5.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Cubic Side Effect</h3>
            This side effect might look a bit basic, but surprisingly it turned out to be the hardest one to get going.
            This is what it has to do:
            <p></p>
            &emsp; 1. Rotate in the direction it's moving.<br>
            &emsp; 2. Bump up and down so that it looks like its rolling along the ground.<br>
            &emsp; 3. Close and open its eyes before and after rolling.
            <p></p>
            Take a look at the source code if you need to understand it better.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/6.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/6.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Crab</h3>
            This enemy is by far, in my mind, the most interesting and visually impressive of them all.
            I started off trying to make the crab's legs from scratch, but it was too complicated to animate just from my head.
            Thankfully, because I could still vaugely picture how it should move, I was able to draw out its rough mechanics using
            a small animation app. This turned out to be really useful as it meant I had a solid example work from.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/7.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/7.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The Last Side Effect</h3>
            In the real game, this enemy hammers his head whenever Drillo jumps on top of it. It's so massive that it would never usually be able
            to fit inside the Snakes And Ladders window, but having it to scale might be a bit impractical in this instance.
