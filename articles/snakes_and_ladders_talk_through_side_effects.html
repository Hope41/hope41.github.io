                This article runs through how the enemies of
                <a class = normal href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a>
                are animated and rendered. Each simplified demo has its source code underneath, so feel free to have a look.
                Pay particular attention to the code inside the <span class = snip>enemy()</span> function, which handles
                the drawing and animation.
                <p></p>
                Almost every enemy uses a very similar walking pattern - one that you may recognise from
                <a class = normal href = /content/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds.html target = _blank>Anthrophobia</a>.
                In case you haven't already seen it, this "walking pattern" is based on a circle with
                a limit at its base:

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Worm-like Stick Thingy</h3>
                Even the first side effect uses this circular walking pattern.
                Notice how the joints move. It's a small change,
                but it's vital to achieve this "forward motion" effect.
            </span>

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Centipede</h3>

                This side effect is very similar to the first one,
                except that its body has been is brought upwards
                so that its legs move instead. The iconic walking motion
                is also more visible in this creature because you can see
                its legs individually.

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Creeper</h3>

                I'm sure you can figure out what's going on here.
            </span>

            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/3.html></div>

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Wolfish Side Effect</h3>

                As you probably have noticed, this enemy also uses the walking motion mentioned earlier.
                Its four feet are divided into two pairs at the moment,
                but here's a challenge: If you paste the code below
                into a new <span class = snip>.html</span> file, can you give the enemy four pairs of legs?
                <p></p>
                Tip: have a look in the <span class = snip>enemy()</span> function.
            </span>

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Monster</h3>

                In the real game, this enemy occasionally spits out cubes - shown
                in the next example - and jumps whenever Drillo runs underneath it.
                This simplified example doesn't have these features,
                but if you want, you can have a look at the real enemy code
                <a class = normal href = https://github.com/Hope41/snakes-and-ladders/effect.js>here</a>.
            </span>

            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/5.html></div>

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Cubic Side Effect</h3>

                I agree that this enemy looks a bit basic,
                but surprisingly it turned out to be the hardest one to get working.
                Overall, this enemy has to go through four main procedures to give
                you the final result.
            </span>

            <div class = quote>
                ∙ Rotate in the direction it's moving <span class = high>(easy)</span><br>
                ∙ Close and open its eyes before and after rolling <span class = high>(not so easy)</span><br>
                ∙ Bump up and down so that it looks like its rolling along the ground <span class = high>(rather tricky)</span><br>
                ∙ Make sure it only stops rolling when resting on an edge <span class = high>(tricky)</span>
            </div>

            <span class = gap>
                Take a look at the source code if you need to understand it better.
            </span>

            <div class = iframe source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/6.html></div>
            <div class = code source = /articles/extra/snakes_and_ladders_talk_through_side_effects/6.html></div>

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Crab</h3>

                Getting the legs to move like this was really hard. In the end,
                it turned out to be really helpful to make a small drawing animation
                of it first before writing it as code. I know, creating "drawing animations"
                of your creatures might sound a bit pointless, but it can actually
                save a lot of time if your creature is already difficult to
                visualise in your head.

            <span class = gap>
                <h3>The Last Side Effect</h3>

                In the real game, this enemy hammers his head whenever Drillo jumps on top of it.
                I've scaled it down a bit so it can fit in on the screen, but usually you can only
                see parts of it. I admit that the walking is slightly weird.

                Well, I <i>was</i> planning on showing you the X-ray Orb here,
                but I decided to leave it out so as not to spoil the game for you,
                in case you haven't played
                <a class = normal href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a>
                yet! Sorry, you'll just have to find out when you get there!
                <p></p>
                Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this trough, and please
                <a class = normal href = mailto:contact@joachimford.uk>contact me</a>
                if you have any further questions!
