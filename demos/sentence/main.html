            This fun demo generates random sentences.<br>
            <button onclick = window.location.href='game.html'>play</button><p></p>

            <h3>How It Works:</h3><p></p>
            To make our sentence, we need a few lists of different types of words:
            <div class = code>
                <span class = key>
                    articles<br>
                    adjectives<br>
                    subject nouns<br>
                    object nouns<br>
                    verbs<br>
                    prepositions<br>
                </span>
            </div>
            Here is a simplified example of what each of those lists might contain:
            <div class = code>
                <span class = note>Articles:</span><br>A, The, Some<p></p>
                <span class = note>Adjectives:</span><br>Little, Bad, Brave<p></p>                
                <span class = note>Subject nouns:</span><br>Cat, Dog, Mouse<p></p>
                <span class = note>Object nouns:</span><br>Hill, Tree, Table<p></p>
                <span class = note>Verbs:</span><br>Jumped, Walked, Ran<p></p>
                <span class = note>Prepositions:</span><br>On, Next to, Beside
            </div>
            Using these words, we can fit them together to make a sentence:
            <div class = code>
                <span style = color:#f40>article +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#0b7>adjective +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#08b>subject noun +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#000>verb +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#0bb>preposition +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#f40>article +</span><br>
                <span style = color:#b96>object noun</span> = sentence
            </div>
            This way, We could make a sentence like, <span style = color:#f40>a</span> <span style = color:#0b7>little</span> <span style = color:#08b>cat</span> <span style = color:#000>walked</span> <span style = color:#0bb>on</span> <span style = color:#f40>the</span> <span style = color:#b96>hill</span>.<br>
            Look at the concept code below:
<div class = code>
<pre>
article = ['a', 'the', 'some']
adjective = ['Little', 'Bad', 'Brave']
subject = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']
object = ['hill', 'tree', 'table']
verb = ['jumped', 'walked', 'ran']
preposition = ['on', 'next to', 'beside']

sentence = ''

sentence += article[random] // add a random word from the 'article' to sentence
sentence += adjective[random]
sentence += subject[random]
sentence += verb[random]
sentence += preposition[random]
sentence += article[random]
sentence += object[random]


print(sentence)
</pre>
</div>
        That is pretty much it.<br>
        However, there are a few problems remaining:
        <div class = code>
            1. When the article is a plural <span class = key>(some)</span>,
            the noun does not have a plural ending<br>
            (we want <span style = color:#b90>'some cats'</span> not <span style = color:#b90>'some cat'</span>).<p></p>

            This problem is solved in the main demo, you can see the source code <a href = 'game-s.html'><span class = note>here</span></a>.
            <hr>
            2. If you add more words to the nouns list,
            you may find words like <span class = string>'mouse'</span> don't turn plural by adding an <span class = string>'s'</span> on the end.<p></p>

            This problem is also solved in the <a href = 'game-s.html'><span class = note>main demo.</span></a><br>
            Look out for <span class = key>'mouse'</span> in the object and subject list.
            <hr>
            3. If an adjective or noun starts with a vowel, then the sentence could be, <span style = color:#b90>'a ant jumped next to a octopus'</span>.<p></p>

            The solution to this is:<br>
            &emsp;• check if the article is <span style = color:#b90>'a'</span><br>
            &emsp;• detect if the adjective or noun starts with a vowel<br>
            &emsp;• add an <span style = color:#b90>'n'</span> to the article<br>
        </div>
        </section>
    </body>
</html>
