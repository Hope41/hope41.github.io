            This simple demo is a good start to understanding how to make a<br>
            <span class = key>psuedo 3D</span>
            <span class = note>(a 2D scene that <i>appears</i> to be 3D)</span>
            world.<p></p>            
            Arrow keys to drive. (if you dont see anything at the start, you need to press the up arrow)<p></p>
            <button onclick = window.location.href='game.html'>play</button><p></p>

            <h3>How It Works:</h3><p></p>
            The road is made up of segments.
            Each segment has different colors and shapes on them to make the world more interesting.
            <iframe src = '1.html'></iframe>
            Now, if we make this segment start small and then get bigger as its y-position increases, we get this:
            <iframe src = '2.html'></iframe>
            Look at the concept code below to understand this:
<div class = code>
<pre>
// Position segment at center of screen
segment_x = screen_width รท 2
segment_y = screen_height รท 2

// Set segment size to 1px
segment_size = 1

function loop:
    segment_size ร= 1.1 // increase size
    segment_y += segment_size รท 100 // increase y-position based on size
    
    // Note:
    //  'a += b' <span class = note>is another way of saying</span> 'a = a + b'
</pre>
</div>
        To make the road properly, we need more segments.<br>
        So, every frame, we generate a new segment on the horizon.<br>
        <iframe src = '3.html'></iframe>
        With multiple segments, the road is taking shape.<p></p>

        Now if we make the road generate segments with a white line on it for a while,
        and then make segments without a line, we get a road like this:
        <iframe src = '4.html'></iframe>
        We can also add corners to the road by generating the segments with an offset:
        <iframe src = '5.html'></iframe>
        <iframe src = '6.html'></iframe>
        Up to now we have drawn the segments as rectangles.<br>
        If don't want to see the rectangles and just want a smooth road, draw polygons between each rectangle.<br>
        The small demo below may help.<p></p>
