                            One of the most important parts of game development
                            is having an attention to detail. This - as with most
                            things - has the potential to go too far, and adding
                            details may become an obsession.
                        </p>
                        <p class = spaced>
                            It's always worth considering (and I'm not saying I
                            did this, by the way) the "focus" of your project from
                            early on; knowing what elements to prioritise will
                            help you make the most of the computer's processing
                            power. After all, even with today's technology, there
                            are still limitations to what a computer can handle.
                        </p>

                        <p class = spaced>
                            This post talks about some of the (pointless?) details
                            I added to the game
                            <a class = link target = _black href = /games/ios-mission>Io's Mission</a>.
                            I've only picked the best ones, so it's not too long.
                            The subjects that follow are listed in no particular
                            order.

                    <h2 class = 'h3 top bottom'>Detail 01. Extremely Accurate Vertical Movement</h2>

                    <div class = 'text shift bottom-huge'>
                        <p class = spaced>
                            For some reason, it was very important to make sure
                            the crabs (the ones in the beach level) walked
                            properly. Did you notice that they moved up and down
                            slightly as they crawled along the sand?
                        </p>

                        <p class = spaced>
                            The difference is only one or two pixels in the real
                            game. I've scaled the crab up a bit so you can see
                            this "walking up and down" more clearly, but I've
                            also put a normal one next to it so you can see the
                            comparison. Note that in its normal state, the
                            vertical movement is unnoticeable. Unless you have
                            very good eyes.
                        </p>

                    <h2 class = 'h3 top bottom'>Detail 02. 100&times; Faint Scanline Weights</h2>

                    <div class = 'text shift bottom-huge'>
                        <p class = spaced>
                            Another detail I'll mention is the scanlines.
                            If you want a technical definition for them, go and
                            look it up, but for the sake of simplicity, scanlines
                            are just horizontal transparent bars stretching from
                            one side of the screen to the other. Did you notice
                            them? You probably did.
                        </p>

                        <p class = spaced>
                            The part I don't expect you to have noticed was the
                            fact that these "scanlines" change strength in different
                            parts of the screen. In the image below, I've exaggerated
                            these weights 100x to help you see them better.
                        </p>

                        <div class = 'demo-img-container top-small-pad bottom-small-pad'>

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p class = spaced>
                            Pointless, if you ask me. However, we must also remember
                            that - as my father used to say - "it's all in the
                            details." When you think about it, you realise that
                            these invisible weights on the scanlines are crucial
                            - crucial! - to the  of Io's Mission. I mean think about it,
                            without these invisible changes to the scanlines, the visual
                            experience of the game would be flat, and uninteresting.
                        </p>

                    <h2 class = 'h3 top bottom'>Detail 03. Invisible Crocodile Feet</h2>

                    <div class = 'text shift bottom-huge'>
                        <p class = spaced>
                            A whole week was spent on the crocodiles. The first
                            day was taken up with deciding on the main colours
                            and shapes, and another two days were taken up with
                            getting the movement right (like sinking and attacking).
                        </p>

                        <p class = spaced>
                            In the remaining four days was left to create the legs and
                            the tail. Trouble is, you hardly EVER see either of
                            those things in the real game. Perhaps you may see
                            the tail for a fleeting moment as ths crocodile
                            splashes towards you, or the legs are revealed for
                            an instant when he jumps, but aside from that
                            these parts are practically invisible.

                            eyes you actually will be able to see the whole
                            crocodile during the game. The swamp is set to only
                            96% opacity, so you can see through in theory. I can't,
                            by the way.

                            the rest has been conveniently bunched into a single

                            Did you notice that Io breathed? Or that, when he
                            transitioned, he used a bezier movement instead of
                            linear? (You probably did, now I think of it. No
                            doubt, as soon as your gaze fell upon him you said
                            to yourself: "Ah, how glad I am he used bezier
                            movement and not linear for his proportional
                            interpolation...") Did you notice that the grass
                            and seaweed swayed in the breeze? Or did you even
                            notice that the water was very, very, slightly
                            transparent? Did you notice the lights flashed
                            on the machines? Or that Drillo's friend was
                            constantly walking?

                            I've officially spent far too much time on pointless
                            details. Does it really add anything to Io's Mission?
                            That's up to you. But for now I'm tired of writing
