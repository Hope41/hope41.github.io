            <h1>Infinite Zoom</h1>

            <div class = iframe source = experiments/infinite_zoom/main.html link = experiments/infinite_zoom/main.html></div>

            <p></p>
            If you're using a mouse or touchpad,
            point in the direction you want to go.
            On a <span class = mobile>mobile device</span>,
            tap on the place where you want to zoom in.
            <p></p>
            This experiment was created around the end of March 2022.<br>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <div class = code source = experiments/infinite_zoom/main.html></div>
            <p></p>
            I have always wanted to make an infinite zoom because I
            enjoy the <span class = italic>limitless exploration</span> factor.
            <p></p>
            I was mainly inspired from
            <a href = https://frankforce.com/screensavers/pixel-words target = _blank>Pixel Words</a>
            by <a href = https://frankforce.com target = _blank>frank force</a>,
            but wanted to make a JavaScript version.
            So, after many months of thinking and two-and-a-half days of developing,
            I got a result I was happy with.
            <p></p>
            This is how it works:
            <p></p>
            &emsp;1. Make a shape that consists of various squares put together.<br>
            &emsp;2. Put the shape on the screen.<br>
            &emsp;3. Zoom in.<br>
            &emsp;4. Once the squares making up the shape are bigger than a specified amount:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;1. Create another shape inside each of the old shapes' squares.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;2. Fade and then remove the old shapes' squares.<br>
            &emsp;5. Keep zooming in.
            <p></p>
            An annoying thing regarding the
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_fillrect.asp target = _blank>JavaScript fillRect()</a>
            method is it starts to get slow when
            drawing over ~1000 rectangles on the screen.
            Apparently, both
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_putimagedata.asp target = _blank>PutImageData()</a>
            and webgl are super fast when drawing rectangles on the screen, but,
            they're a bit unfamiliar for me and I am going to stick with the slow technique for now.
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <span class = italic>...One day later...</span>
            <p></p>
            <br>
            After writing that last paragraph, something inside me changed.
            I suddenly realised that I was being weak and fixed in my old habits.
            <span class = italic>'Who am I?'</span>,
            I thought. <span class = italic>'Who am I, to stop here?
            The future lies ahead of me, and is open to my adventure.'</span>
            And at that very moment, I firmly resolved to attempt to create a faster,
            smoother and better version.
            <p></p>
            Here it is!
            <p></p>
            The people who don't bother to read pages all the way to the bottom should now know better.
            That famous saying has been proved true once more,
            <span class = italic>'the cream sinks to the bottom'</span>.
            <p></p>
            If you can be bothered, please read on below the improved example to understand how it works.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/infinite_zoom/1.html link = experiments/infinite_zoom/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            <div class = code source = experiments/infinite_zoom/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            In the end I didn't use putImageData() <span class = italic>or</span> Webgl.
            Instead, I made a new canvas for the icon which was then called up whenever I wanted to draw one.
            This is a much faster technique and I therefore was able to generate icons from a greater
            distance without the performance suffering on most devices.
            These are the steps the program takes:
            <p></p>
            &emsp;1. Make a canvas that fits the screen.<br>
            &emsp;2. Make another canvas whose width and height is the same as the icon's
            width and height (i.e. 6x6).<br>
            &emsp;3. Call up the canvas using drawImage() when ever you want to use it.
            <p></p>
            The rest of the steps are covered in the previous list.
