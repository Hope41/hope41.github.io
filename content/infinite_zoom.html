            <h1>Infinite Zoom</h1>
            <div class = iframe source = /infinite-zoom link = /infinite-zoom></div>
            <p></p>
            If you're using a mouse or touchpad,
            point in the direction you want to go.
            On a <span class = mobile>mobile device</span>,
            tap on the place where you want to zoom in.
            <p></p>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <div class = code source = /infinite-zoom lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            The main inspiration came from
            <a href = https://frankforce.com/screensavers/pixel-words target = _blank>Pixel Words</a>
            by <a href = https://frankforce.com target = _blank>Frank Force</a>,
            but I wanted to make a JavaScript version.
            So, after many months of thinking and two-and-a-half days of developing,
            I got an, overly simplified, but still satisfying result.
            <p></p>
            This is how it works:
            <p></p>
            &emsp;1. Make an image that consists of various squares put together.<br>
            &emsp;2. Draw the image on the screen.<br>
            &emsp;3. Zoom in.<br>
            &emsp;4. Once the squares making up the image are bigger than a specified amount:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;1. Create a cloned image inside each of the old images' squares.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;2. Fade and then remove the old image.<br>
            &emsp;5. Keep zooming in.
            <p></p>
            An annoying thing regarding the
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_fillrect.asp target = _blank>JavaScript fillRect()</a>
            method is it starts to get slow when drawing over ~1000 rectangles on the screen.
            Apparently, both
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_putimagedata.asp target = _blank>PutImageData()</a>
            and
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL target = _blank>webgl</a>
            are super fast for that kind of thing,
            but I went for a much simpler technique:
            Instead of drawing a rectangle for every single segment of the face icon,
            I created an image (which HTML calls a 
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp target = _blenk>canvas</a>)
            that represented the icon.
            This meant I could draw double the distance without the performance suffering greatly.
            <p></p>
            This was my previous version that used rectangles:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/infinite_zoom/rubbish.html link = experiments/infinite_zoom/rubbish.html></div>
            <p></p>
            Of course, it is possible to render a higher depth image at the start,
            meaning we would get an even finer precision without a slackening of
            performance, but at the moment I think it looks fine.
