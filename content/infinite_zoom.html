            If you're using a mouse or touchpad,
            point in the direction you want to go.
            On a <span class = mobile>mobile device</span>,
            tap on the place where you want to zoom in. Alternatively,
            if you leave it long enough, the automatic mouse will move around for you.
            <p></p>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <div class = code source = /infinite-zoom lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            The main inspiration for this project came from
            <a href = https://frankforce.com/screensavers/pixel-words target = _blank>Pixel Words</a>
            by <a href = https://frankforce.com target = _blank>Frank Force</a>, and I wanted to see
            if I could make something like it, as infinite zooms have always interested me.
            <p></p>
            This is how it works:
            <p></p>
            <div class = menu>
                ∙ make an image that consists of various squares put together<br>
                ∙ draw the image on the screen<br>
                ∙ zoom in<br>
                ∙ once the squares making up the image are bigger than a specified amount:<br>
                &emsp;∙ create a clone of the image inside each of its squares<br>
                &emsp;∙ fade and remove the old image<br>
                ∙ continue zooming in
            </div>
            <p></p>
            An annoying thing regarding the
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_fillrect.asp target = _blank>JavaScript fillRect()</a>
            method is it starts to get slow when drawing over ~1000 rectangles on the screen.
            Apparently, both
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_putimagedata.asp target = _blank>PutImageData()</a>
            and
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL target = _blank>webgl</a>
            are super fast for that kind of thing,
            but I went for a much simpler technique:
            Instead of drawing a rectangle for every single segment of the face icon,
            I created an image (which HTML calls a 
            <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp target = _blenk>canvas</a>)
            that represented the icon.
            This meant I could draw double the distance without the performance suffering greatly.
            <p></p>
            Anyway, hopefully this page was at least a little bit helpful, and maybe it'll
            lead to a larger implementation in the future!
