            </div>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>The main inspiration for this project came from
                <a class = normal href = https://frankforce.com/screensavers/pixel-words target = _blank>Pixel Words</a>
                by <a class = normal href = https://frankforce.com target = _blank>Frank Force</a>, and I wanted to see
                if I could make something like it, as infinite zooms have always interested me.</p>

                <p>This is how it works:</p>

                <div class = subDemo>
                    ∙ Create a low resolution image (in this instance, a face)<br>
                    ∙ Draw the image on the screen<br>
                    ∙ Zoom in<br>
                    ∙ Once the pixels making up the image are bigger than a certain amount:<br>
                    &emsp;∙ Create a duplicate of the image inside each of its pixels<br>
                    &emsp;∙ Fade and remove the old image<br>
                    ∙ Continue zooming in
                </div>

                <p>An annoying thing regarding the JavaScript
                <a class = normal href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_fillrect.asp target = _blank>fillRect()</a>
                method is it starts to get slow when drawing more than 1000 rectangles on the screen.
                Apparently, both
                <a class = normal href = https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/canvas_putimagedata.asp target = _blank>PutImageData()</a>
                and
                <a class = normal href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL target = _blank>webgl</a>
                are super fast for that kind of thing,
                but I went for a much easier (but worse) approach:
                Instead of drawing a rectangle for every pixel of the face,
                I created an image (which HTML calls a 
                <a class = normal href = https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp target = _blenk>canvas</a>)
                that represented the icon.
                This meant I could draw double the distance without the performance suffering too much.</p>
