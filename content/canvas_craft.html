                to easily make images, game levels, and entire worlds within minutes.
                It's very new, so please raise an issue on GitHub if you find any glitches.</b></p>

            <div class = demo>
                <p>The following page is a very brief documentation of how to start using CanvasCraft.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>When you first open Canvas Craft and click on the screen, it will take you to a page
                that looks a bit like this.</p>
                <div class = big><img class = img src = /content/extra/canvas_craft/1.png></div>
                <p>You can create shapes using the "Block" tool (selected by default), or the "Line"
                tool. To draw a shape on your canvas, simply drag your mouse across the white square.</p>
                <div class = big><img class = img src = /content/extra/canvas_craft/2.png></div>
                <p>After creating a few rectangles, you'll probably want to give them different textures.</p>
                <p>Select one of them (by clicking on it) and take a look at the panel on the top-left of the
                screen. This panel contains all the statistics for the selected shape. Scroll down untill you come
                to the "Textures" heading and either press "Upload Image" to add an image from your device,
                or choose a texture from the list of presets. Press "Run Code" to apply the preset to your shape.</p>
                <p>At this point, you may notice a code box just below the list of presets. This allows you
                to customise exactly what texture you wish your shape to have. If you have some knowledge on
                how to write in JavaScript and on how RGB colours work, it should be quite simple. The two inputs
                of the code box are the X and Y coordinates of a pixel. The code will take these coordinates, do
                some fancy things to them, and finally "return" a colour made of Red, Green and Blue values.</p>
                <div class = hint>
                    <img src = /svg/bulb.svg>
                    <p>Imagine the code box as simply a long algebra equation.
                    Algebra is all about numbers represented
                    by letters. Take the equation <span class = snip>X &times; X = A</span>
                    for instance. If <span class = snip>X = 1</span>, it means
                    <span class = snip>A = 1</span>.
                    But if <span class = snip>X = 2</span>,
                    it means <span class = snip>A = 4</span>.
                    The code box works in a similar way. You can apply maths to the X and Y inputs
                    and return an RGB colour based on that.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If you still don't understand, don't worry! I added the feature to CanvasCraft
                because it makes game level design much quicker. For example, if I wanted to add
                a simple brick to my image, I would first select an orangey-pink colour from the selector
                on the topnav. Then, I would drag on the canvas with the "Block" tool to create a
                brick shape on the screen. To make a brick <i>texture</i>, I would select
                the "Noise" preset and press "Run Code." If I wanted the
                noise to be more extreme, I could change the amount <span class = snip>Math.random()</span>
                is multiplied.</p>
                <div class = big><img class = img src = /content/extra/canvas_craft/3.png></div>

                <p>Canvas Craft is still in early stages of development, but there are still many
                other features that haven't been covered on this page. If you think CanvasCraft
                might be helpful to you, make sure you check out its
