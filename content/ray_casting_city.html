            <h1>Ray-casting City</h1>
            <div class = image source = /images/ray_casting_city_big.png link = experiments/ray_casting_city/main.html></div>

            <p></p>
            A small project developed throughout March 2022<br>
            Use the <mark>Arrows / WASD / ZQSD</mark> to move around a procedural 1000x1000 city.
            <p></p>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <div class = code source = experiments/ray_casting_city/main.html></div>
            This experiment was fun to make, but also, as I began trying to add more
            features I realised that ray casting, great as it is, is very limited and tricky
            to grow from.<p></p>
            The concept of a ray-caster is very simple.
            Although it may appear to look 3D, it is actually using 2D logic to project
            various rectangles onto a canvas in such a manner that it looks 3D.
            <p></p>
            This is a ray.
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            ...And these are some rectangles.
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            If you make collision with the ray and the rectangles...
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/3.html></div>
            <p></p>
            ...and add multiple rays within a limit,
            you have the base structure for the 3D casting.
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/4.html></div>
            <p></p>
            So, take the ray on the far left.
            That ray has a unique length based on what it's colliding with.
            If a rectangle was drawn on the far left of the screen,
            and its height corresponded to the length of the ray
            (i.e. the longer the ray, the shorter the rectangle),
            you would have actually completed the main part of ray-casting.
            <p></p>
            This...
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/3.html></div>
            <p></p>
            ...would make something similar to this...
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/5.html></div>
            <p></p>
            ...And with more rays, something like this:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/6.html></div>
            <p></p>
            It's looking a bit more 3D now!
            Now if we add a higher resolution (i.e. making a ray for every ~pixel),
            this would be the result:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/ray_casting_city/7.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This is the source code for the demo above:
            <p></p>
