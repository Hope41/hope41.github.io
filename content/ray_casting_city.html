            A small 3D project developed throughout March 2022. Use the
            <mark>Arrows, WASD, or ZQSD</mark> to move around a procedural city.
            <p></p>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <div class = code source = /ray-casting-city lang = html></div>
            Although this experiment was fun to make, I realised as I went along
            that ray casting is actually pretty limited with its flexability. This
            is why a lot of people have turned to methods like ray-tracing, ray-marching,
            and others which are ways to improve the somewhat lifeless results
            of ray-casting.
            <p></p>
            The concept of a ray-caster is very simple.
            Although it may appear to look 3D, it is actually using 2D logic to project
            various rectangles onto a canvas in such a manner that it looks 3D. Here is how it works.
            <p></p>
            This is a single ray with some rectangles around it.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This part makes sure the ray stops at the closest rectangle.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This example just uses more rays.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/3.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This is actually the entirety of ray-casting.
            Take the ray on the far left.
            The ray has a unique length based on what it's colliding with.
            Let's draw a rectangle on the far left of the screen,
            where its height corresponds to the length of our ray
            (i.e. the longer the ray, the shorter the rectangle).
            A ray moving around like this...
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            ...would look something similar to this:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/4.html></div>
            <p></p>
            By implememting more rays, the result would look like this:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/5.html></div>
            <p></p>
            It's looking a bit more 3D now, isn't it?
            If we added a higher resolution (i.e. making a ray for every ~pixel),
            this would be the result:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/ray_casting_city/6.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This is the source code for the demo above:
            <p></p>
            <div class = code source = extra/ray_casting_city/6.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
