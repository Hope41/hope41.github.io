            <h1>Anthrophobia</h1>

            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/main.html link = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/main.html></div>

            <p></p>
            This experiment began with a <a href = https://www.dwitter.net/d/24669 target = _blank>dweet</a>
            I made on the very last day of 2021. I felt it needed growing and began making a bigger version (this).
            <p></p>
            The complete source code is here:
            <p></p>
            <div class = code source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/main.html></div>
            <p></p>
            Making procedural creatures was surprisingly simple.
            The idea is to generate a simple box like creature,
            apply randomness to it's colour, body height, arm length, leg length, eye distance ect..,
            and then move each 'man' in a random direction, stop at intervals,
            blink and move it's eyes. Admittedly, the code is not as neat as I thought it was when I made it,
            but it works and is still useful.
            <p></p>
            As you probably guessed, the <a href = ../index.html>home page</a>
            of this website is a greyscale version of this experiment.
            <p></p>
            The way I achieved the walking on some of the creatures relies on a simple circular movement:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This movement is then limited near the bottom to create a walking motion:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            By stretching the movement vertically, it can look like a more of a marching walk:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/3.html></div>
            <div class = code source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/3.html></div>
            <p></p>
            Remember: If you apply <mark>sine</mark> to an ever growing value,
            it will return a number swaying between 1 and -1,
            moving quickly around the zero mark, but slowing down at the edges.
            The same goes for <mark>cosine</mark>, only it has an offset of .5:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/4.html></div>
            <p></p>
            So, if you apply <mark>sine</mark> to the x position of an object and <mark>cosine</mark> to the y position,
            It will create the circular movement shown below:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = experiments/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/5.html></div>
