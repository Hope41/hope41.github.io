            <h1>Anthrophobia — Fear Of Crowds</h1>

            <div class = iframe source = /anthrophobia link = /anthrophobia></div>

            <p></p>
            This experiment began with a <a href = https://www.dwitter.net/d/24669 target = _blank>dweet</a>
            I made on the very last day of 2021.
            It looked like it had potential so I began making this larger implementation.
            <p></p>
            Here is the complete source code:
            <p></p>
            <div class = code source = /anthrophobia lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            Making procedural creatures like these is actually surprisingly simple.
            The idea is to generate a simple box like creature,
            apply randomness to it's colour, body height, arm length, leg length, eye distance ect...,
            and then move each 'man' in a random direction, stop at intervals, blink, and move its eyes.<br>
            You may have noticed that the <a href = />home page</a> is a greyscale version of this experiment.
            <p></p>
            The way some of the creatures walk is based on a circular movement:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/1.html></div>
            <p></p>
            This movement is then limited near the bottom to create a walking motion:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/2.html></div>
            <p></p>
            The manner of the walk can be changed by stretching its vertical or horizontal movement:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/3.html></div>
            <div class = code source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/3.html lang = html></div>
            <p></p>
            Remeber that if <mark>sine</mark> is applied to an ever growing value,
            it will return a number swaying between 1 and -1;
            moving quickly around the zero mark, but slowing down at the edges.
            The same goes for <mark>cosine</mark>, only it has an offset of 90°.
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/4.html></div>
            <p></p>
            So, if <mark>sine</mark> is applied to the x position of an object and <mark>cosine</mark> to the y position,
            It will create the circular movement shown below:
            <p></p>
            <div class = iframe source = extra/anthrophobia_fear_of_crowds/5.html></div>
            <p></p>
