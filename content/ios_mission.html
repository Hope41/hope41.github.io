                <span class = high>Io's Mission</span> is a fully-featured platform adventure
                where Io saves his friends from The Great Ominous.
                <p></p>
                The runtime for this game is about half an hour, but it saves your
                progress in case you need a break. All controls are explained in
                the first few levels of the game.</b>

                Well, I'm glad that's over! I've spent almost a year and a half on this game, and it only takes
                half an hour to play. Never mind, I'm sure it was worth it in some way or another.
                <p></p>
                The entire source code for this game is huge. 
                The source code for <a class = normal href = /content/the_mitigator.html target = _blank>The Mitigator</a> was just over 100kb,
                <a class = normal href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a> was about 200kb,
                but Io's Mission is nearly 1000kb.
                Of course, a lot of this figure is taken up by the sound files, but there's still a lot of hand-written code
                in there - about half of it.
                In relatable terms, this game is over half a million characters long.

            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <div class = quote>
                ∙ When making platform games, don't try to generating your levels purely with algorithms.
                <p></p>
                ∙ Make sure you think about the structure of the game before you begin. How do I want the actors to move? What order should I draw things in? What features will be useful for other parts of the game?
                <p></p>
                ∙ Make sure the main character looks good in your mind before adding him to your game. It's saves a lot of time.
                <p></p>
                ∙ Have a good idea of the gameplay before starting. What's the aim? How can I make it fun to play?
            </div>
            <span class = gap>
                Making <span class = high>Io's Mission</span> taught me loads.
