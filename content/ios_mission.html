                <b>Help Io climb the tower before his friends are thrown into the dungeons!
                Io's Mission is a fully-featured platform adventure
                where Io saves his friends from The Great Ominous.
                <p></p>
                The runtime for this game is about half an hour, but it saves your
                progress in case you need a break. All controls are explained in
                the first few levels of the game.</b>

                <p>Well, I'm glad that's over! I've spent almost a year and a half on this game, and it only takes
                half an hour to play. Never mind, I'm sure it was worth it in some way or another.</p>

                <p>The entire source code for this game is huge. 
                The source code for <a class = normal href = /content/the_mitigator.html target = _blank>The Mitigator</a> was just over 100kb,
                <a class = normal href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a> was about 200kb,
                but Io's Mission adds up to almost 1000kb.
                Of course, a lot of this figure is taken up by the sound files, but there's still a lot of hand-written code
                in there - about half of it.
                In relatable terms, this game is over half a million characters long.</p>

            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>∙ When making platform games, don't try to generating your
                levels purely with algorithms.</p>

                <p>∙ Make sure you think about the structure of the game before
                you begin. How do I want the actors to move? What order
                should I draw things in? What features will be useful for
                other parts of the game?</p>

                <p>∙ Make sure the main character looks good in your mind
                before adding him to your game. It's saves a lot of time.</p>

                <p>∙ Have a good idea of the gameplay before starting. What's
                the aim? How can I make it fun to play?</p>
