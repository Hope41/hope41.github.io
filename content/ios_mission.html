            Help Io climb the tower before his friends are thrown into the dungeons!
            <span class = gr>Io's Mission</span> is a fully-featured platform adventure
            where Io saves his friends from The Great Ominous.

            The runtime for this game is about half an hour, but it saves your progress in case you need a break.
            All controls are explained in the first few levels of the game.

            Well, I'm glad that's over! I've spent almost a year and a half on this game already, and it only takes
            30 minutes to play. Never mind, I'm sure it was worth it in some way or another.
            <p></p>
            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <p></p>
            <div class = menu>
                ∙ When making adventure games, don't generate most of your level with algorithms. (It's called procedural generation if you want the term. It does have it's upsides, but it should be used sparingly.)
                <p></p>
                ∙ Make sure you think about the structure of the game before starting development. How do I want the actors to move? What order should I draw things in? What features will be useful for other parts of the game?
                <p></p>
                ∙ Make sure the main character looks good in your mind before adding him to your game. It's saves a lot of time. I can say that from experience.
                <p></p>
                ∙ Have a good idea of the gameplay before starting. What should be the aim? How can I make it fun to play? Special effects can come later.

            The entire source code for this game is huge. 
            The source code for <a href = /content/the_mitigator.html target = _blank>The Mitigator</a> was just over 100kb,
            <a href = /content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a> was about 200kb,
            but Io's Mission is nearly 1000kb.
            Of course, a lot of this figure is taken up by the sound files, but there's still a lot of hand-written code
            in there - about half of it.
            In relatable terms, I've typed over half a million characters to make this game.
