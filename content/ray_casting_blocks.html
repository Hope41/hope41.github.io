            <div class = demo>
                <p>I must say, although this experiment was very fun to make,
                ray casting is actually quite limited when it comes to flexability.
                That's why nowadays a lot of people have turned to methods like ray tracing, ray marching,
                and other things which have been able to extend the limitations of ray casting.
                It's still an awesome tool though, and I recommend it to anyone who's
                new to coding in three dimentions (like me.)</p>

                <p>The concept of a ray-caster is really simple.
                Although it looks 3D, it really only uses 2D logic and then converts it
                to 3D at the end. Here is how it works in three easy steps.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3>~ STEP 1 ~</h3>

                <p>Create a bunch of rays (or "lines" if you prefer), but make sure
                each ray stops when it hits an obstacle, and that it has a maximum length</p>
            </div>

            <iframe src = extra/ray_casting_blocks/1.html></iframe>
            <div class = code>// go through amount of iterations
for (let j = 0; j < rayItr; j ++) {
    length = j * rayJmp

    // increment the the far end of the ray as it shoots away from the camera
    x += Math.cos(ang) * rayJmp
    y += Math.sin(ang) * rayJmp

    // check if it has touched a solid block
    if (map.a[Math.floor(x) + Math.floor(y) * map.w] > 0)
        break
}</div>
            <div class = demo>
                <h3>~ STEP 2 ~</h3>

                <p>On your real screen, draw a rectangle for each ray you have. Its
                position is based on the ray you're dealing with.
                Its height is determined by the length of the ray.</p>

            <div class = code>ray on the left = rectangle on the left
longer ray = shorter rectangle</div>

                <p>This is what it looks like. Not the most amazing graphics, I admit.</p>
            </div>
            <iframe src = extra/ray_casting_blocks/2.html></iframe>
            <div class = code>const w = cvs.width / rayAmt
const h = 10 / length * scale
const s = 100 / length

ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb('+s+','+s+','+s+')'
ctx.fillRect(i * w, cvs.height / 2 - h / 2, w, h)</div>
            <div class = demo>
                <h3>~ STEP 3 ~</h3>

                <p>Well, no matter what you think of it, you have already created a ray
                casted scene. That wasn't so hard was it?</p>

                <p>Ray casting can actually be really
                useful for certain types of games. A taxi delivery game or a maze would work
                well, or even an FPS, if you like that kind of thing!</p>

                <p>All we need now is more rays! I've also moved the camera (which is
                basically just the starting point of the rays) to help
                you get a better picture of what's happening.</p>

                <p>After writing that last sentence, I decided to really see how short
                I could get the above example. Turns out, the entire code can sit
                quite happily at 273 characters.
                You can try getting it even smaller if you like!</p>

                <p>Hopefully this page was slightly helpful, and maybe I'll
                make something big using ray casting in the future. It's pretty
                hard to overcome the initial limitations, but if you can do it
                it's a great trick to have up your sleeve!</p>
