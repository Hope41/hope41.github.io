# Joachimford.uk
> [Joachimford.uk](https://joachimford.uk) is my personal website. It contains JavaScript projects, experiments and games that can all be played on a desktop computer and often mobile devices as well.

Things planned:
- Articles explaining certain aspects of larger projects
- New games including a platform runner that's currently in development

More coming soon!

Feel free to contact me at [contact@joachimford.uk](mailto:contact@joachimford.uk) or raise an issue on github if you have any ideas.
