# Joachimford.uk
> [Joachimford.uk](https://joachimford.uk) is my personal website that contains JavaScript projects, experiments and games that can all be played on a desktop computer and, occasionally, mobile devices as well.

Things planned:
- Articles explaining and illustrating certain aspects of bigger projects
- New games including a platform runner that's currently in development

More coming soon!

Feel free to contact me at [contact@joachimford.uk](mailto:contact@joachimford.uk), or raise an issue on github if you have any ideas or thoughts.
