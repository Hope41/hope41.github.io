            I've just finished another <a href = https://jobase.org>JoBase</a> game!
            Use your helicopter to explore a procedural world of procedural enemies with procedural powers!
            The game can go on forever, but my current record is 8581m
            (I could have carried on, but I'd already spent some hours on it and was getting bored).
            Anyway, feel free to <a href = mailto:contact@joachimford.uk>email me</a> your score if you like,
            and I hope you enjoy it!<br>
            You can play the game by typing
            <span class = snip>python -m JoBase.examples.squirtcopter</span> into the terminal.
            Alternatively, you can play it online
            <a href = https://jobase.org/games/squirtcopter target = _blank>here</a>.
            (I'll just mention that the online version of JoBase can be a bit laggy.
            For best performance, download JoBase and run the game from there)
            <p></p>
            You can find its source code <a href = https://github.com/JoBase/JoBase/tree/main/JoBase/examples/squirtcopter target = blank>here</a>.

            <h2>Blue Hue</h2>
            <span class = description>A JoBase Platform Game</span>
            <p></p>
            <div class = big><img src = /news/blue_hue.png></div>
            <p></p>
            I have just finished making a new platform game for
            <a href = https://jobase.org target = _blank>JoBase</a> - a fast python library for beginner coders.
            <p></p>
            JoBase has been a collaboration between me and <a href = https://greyhope.uk target = _blank>my brother</a>
            for a while now, and it's nice to finally have given it a solid contribution.<br>
            You can play Blue Hue by installing JoBase (and Python, if you haven't already) and running the command
            <span class = snip>python -m JoBase.examples.blue_hue</span> into the terminal.
            Feel free to check its source code on
            <a href = https://github.com/JoBase/JoBase/tree/main/JoBase/examples/blue_hue target = blank>Github</a>.
