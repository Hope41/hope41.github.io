                <h3>Introduction &bull; The Character Himself</h3>

                <p>The development of
                <a class = normal href = /src/content/ios_mission target = _blank>Io's Mission</a>
                ran me into a lot of challenges. I was unsure - even when I'd
                been making it for almost a year - whether I'd really be able to
                pull it off.
                It may sound surprising to you, but the most complicated
                part of the whole game turned out to be <b>Io</b>
                himself.</p>

                <p>He went through a lot of changes as he grew older. For a
                long time, his head didn't lean forward as he walked, and
                the even the swing of his arms was absent.
                His appearence changed as well. Here is a picture of his
                growth over time.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class = big><img class = img src = /src/blogs/extra/using_inverse_kinematics_to_animate_your_character/2.png></div>

            <div class = demo id = movement>
                <h3>The Transitioning Extravaganza &bull; The Rough Concept</h3>
                <p>Aside from everything I've already mentioned, I view the most
                interesting - and challenging, if you haven't done it before -
                part of Io's functionings to be his
                "transitioning between states."</p>

                <p>I don't know if you noticed, but whenever Io
                changed position (like rolling or jumping into the sea),
                he would take a few frames to "transition" between poses.
                In other words, his body joints would smoothly move
                to a new position, instead of just switching immidiately.</p>

                <p>Look closely at the example below to understand it better.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <iframe src = /src/blogs/extra/using_inverse_kinematics_to_animate_your_character/3.html></iframe>
            <br>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>In the first part of the example, Io "jolts" to the next position.
                In the second part, Io slowly transitions between states to give
                the character a more natural feel.</p>

                <p>It may be a bit tricky to implement at first,
                but the results will definitely pay off!</p>

            <div class = demo>
                <h3 id = code>Getting to the Code &bull; Animating the Character</h3>

                <p>So far we've only discussed this "smooth transitioning" in concept.
                Now we're going to go slightly further by looking at what we
                need to do in <i>code.</i></p>

                <p>Let's start by constructing a template character. He has
                a few main joints and some abilities - like walking, standing
                and climbing. The first stage is getting him (or her) on the screen.
                That's quite easy, so let's skip to the next step - defining each joint.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h4 id = step1>STEP 1: Defining Each Joint</h4>
                <p>To do this, create a dictionary that stores all of your character's
                <b>moving parts.</b></p>

<pre class = code>const hero = {
    arm1: 0, // angle
    arm2: 0,
    leg1: 0,
    leg2: 0,
    ang: 0,
    eyex: 0, // position
    eyey: 0,
    body: 0
}</pre>

                <p>As well as defining these variables, make sure they actually
                <i>change</i> what the hero looks like.
                For example, if <span class = snip>hero.arm1</span>
                is set to <span class = snip>1</span>, the character on the screen
                should have his arm at an angle of one radian.</p>
            </div>


            <div class = demo>
                <h4 id = step2>STEP 2: Setting the Hero's State</h4>

                <p>The next step is to define what <i>state</i> our character is currently
                in. Create a new variable to determine what he's doing.</p>

<pre class = code>activeState = 'walking'</pre>

                <p>Now we need to move the hero based on his state.
                Have a look at the code below to understand how to do this.</p>

<pre class = code>// this changes the hero's joints based on the inputted state
function changeHeroJoints(inputState) {

    if (inputState == 'walking') {
        // the code below is merely an example of
        // how you may want a walking character to move

        const sway = .3 + Math.cos(time / 5) * .05
        hero.arm1 = -.5
        hero.arm2 = .5
        hero.leg1 = Math.sin(time / 10) * .5 - sway
        hero.leg2 = Math.sin(time / 10 + Math.PI) * .5 - sway
        hero.eyex = .2
        hero.ang = sway
        hero.body = 1.5
    }
}

activeState = 'walking'

// this runs every frame
function update() {
    requestAnimationFrame(update)

    // a number that tells us how many frames have gone by
    time += 1

    // update the hero joints
    changeHeroJoints(activeState)


#    draw hero ect...
</pre>

            <p>I'll explain a little of what the code above actually does.
            Remember we created a string called <span class = snip>activeState</span>?
            This "keyword" is put into the <span class = snip>changeHeroJoints()</span>
            function, which in turn updates the character's body parts. If you
            need help, read the comments within the code.</p>

            <p>The character should now be moving based on what is entered into
            the <span class = snip>changeHeroJoints()</span> function.
            In the code below, I've given the character another state: climbing.</p>

<pre class = code>#        hero.leg2 = Math.cos(time) * .5
#        hero.eyex = 1
#    }

    else if (inputState == 'climbing') {
        hero.arm1 = 1.3 + Math.sin(time / 10) * .5
        hero.arm2 = 1.3 + Math.sin(time / 10 + Math.PI) * .5
        hero.leg1 = 1 + Math.sin(time / 10) * .5
        hero.leg2 = 1 + Math.sin(time / 10 + Math.PI) * .5
        hero.ang = Math.cos(time / 10) * .05
        hero.eyex = -.2
        hero.body = 1.5
    }
}

activeState = 'walking'

function update() {
    requestAnimationFrame(update)

    time += 1

    // change the state of the hero every second
    if (time % 200 < 1) {
        if (activeState == 'walking')
            activeState = 'climbing'

        else activeState = 'walking'
    }

    // update the hero joints
    changeHeroJoints(activeState)


#    draw hero ect...
</pre>
</div>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>Well that was a lot of coding! Thankfully that's the end of
                the set-up code, and the rest should <i>hopefully</i> be a
                little easier to understand.
                Right now, our character behaves much like
                the "switching" Io - shown earlier -
                and that's just unacceptable.</p>

                <p>Without further ado, let us now commence with the implementation of our famous
                Transitioning Extravaganza, and press on to the final
                part of this section.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = demo>
                <h4 id = step3>STEP 3: Coding The Transitioning Extravaganza</h4>

                <p>We're finally at step three. Let's have a quick recap by taking
                a look at the comparison again.</p>
            </div>

            <iframe src = /src/blogs/extra/using_inverse_kinematics_to_animate_your_character/4.html></iframe>

            <div class = demo>
                <p>So, how do we make it smooth? The first stage is turn our <span class = snip>hero</span>
                dictionary into a function. Sounds pointless, but it will be very
                useful later on.</p>

                <p>Write your code a bit like this:</p>

<pre class = code>// creates a new template body and returns it
function createBody() {
    return {
        arm1: 0,
        arm2: 0,
        leg1: 0,
        leg2: 0,
        eyex: 0,
        eyey: 0,
        body: 0,
        ang: 0
    }
}
const hero = createBody()
</pre>

                <p>Our <span class = snip>changeHeroJoints()</span> function also
                needs a slight change-around. Instead of <i>directly</i> manipulating
                the character's body, change the function so that it returns
                a new body instead, which can be used later on.</p>

                <p>Pay particular attention to the comments in the following updated code.</p>

<pre class = code>const hero = createBody()

function changeHeroJoints(inputState) {

    // create a new template body
    const bod = createBody()

    // notice that we now use "bod" instead of "hero" when moving the joints
    if (inputState == 'walking') {
        bod.leg1 = Math.sin(time) * .5

#        (...)
    }

    else if (inputState == 'climbing') {

#        (...)
    }

    // return the new body pose from the function
    return bod
}


// oldState represents the state we're moving from
oldState = ''

// activeState represents the state we're aiming for
activeState = 'walking'

// a decimal value representing our progress
// through the transition. We will use it later
transition = 0


function update() {
    requestAnimationFrame(update)

#    (...)

    // get old and new expected body positions
    const oldBody = changeHeroJoints(oldState)
    const newBody = changeHeroJoints(activeState)


#    draw hero ect...
</pre>

                <p>At the moment, the code shown above won't do anything. If you look
                carefully, you'll notice that our <span class = snip>hero</span>
                body isn't being changed.</p>

                <p>The code is very incomplete, so let's finish it off. Have a read
                of the comments if you need help.</p>

<pre class = code>
#function createBody() {
#    return {
#        (...)
#    }
#}

// Create a new array representing all the moving parts
// in our hero's body. This is important
const arr = [
    'arm1',
    'arm2',
    'leg1',
    'leg2',
    'eyex',
    'eyey',
    'body',
    'ang'
]

const hero = createBody()

oldState = ''
activeState = 'walking'

function update() {
    requestAnimationFrame(update)

#    (...)

    const oldBody = changeHeroJoints(oldState)
    const newBody = changeHeroJoints(activeState)

    // transition if has not met goal
    if (oldState != activeState) {
        transition += .02

        // reset transition if finished
        if (transition >= 1) {
            transition = 0
            oldState = activeState
        }

        // iterate through all the body parts
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {
            const oldPart = oldBody[arr[i]]
            const newPart = newBody[arr[i]]
            const dist = newPart - oldPart

            // change the hero's joints
            hero[arr[i]] = oldPart + (dist * transition)
        }
    }
    // set straight away if not transitioning
    if (!transition)
        hero = newBody


#        draw hero ect...
</pre>

                <p>Well, what is the code doing? First, we created a new array -
                one that directly mirrored the contents of our <span class = snip>
                createBody()</span> function.</p>

                <p>Later, in our <span class = snip>update()</span> loop, we went
                through every body part <b>one by one,</b> and changed the hero's
                body based on the transition's progress.</p>

                <p>We can actually give one small improvement to this code.
                Currently, the transition works in a "linear" way, but it
                looks much better (in my opinion anyway) to have it move
                in a "bezier" fashion. Take a look at the difference to see what I mean.</p>
            </div>

            <iframe src = /src/blogs/extra/using_inverse_kinematics_to_animate_your_character/5.html></iframe>

            <div class = demo>
                <p>It's a very, very small difference. It's all about the "feel" you get from it.
                When it was transitioning, did you think first
                one looked slightly robotic, whereas the other was a bit smoother?</p>

                <p>If you didn't notice a difference you don't need to worry about it,
                but for those who like minor details (like me), make this one small edit.
                No need to worry about figuring out the maths.</p>

<pre class = code>hero[arr[i]] = oldPart + (dist * (.5 + Math.cos(transition * Math.PI + Math.PI) * .5))</pre>

                <p>To discover more pointless details from

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>Phew! That was a lot of coding! I only really touched on one aspect of Io's
                code on this page, but it's something I've always struggled with, and I wrote
                it to help fellow coders who are puzzling with it too.</p>

                <p>I admit it is a little complicated, but it's a very good thing to get working.
                And remember it's always easier the second time round!</p>

                <p>Below is the code for a working version of smooth transitioning.
                It might be useful to refer to.</p>
