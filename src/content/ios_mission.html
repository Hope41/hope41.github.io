                        Help Io climb the tower before his friends are thrown into the dungeons!
                        Io's Mission is a fully-featured platform adventure
                        where Io saves his friends from The Great Ominous.

                        The runtime for this game is about half an hour, but it saves your
                        progress in case you need a break. All controls are explained in
                        the first few levels of the game.

                <p>Well, I'm glad that's over! I've spent almost a year and a half on this game, and it only takes
                half an hour to play. Never mind, I'm sure it was worth it in some way or another.</p>

                <p>The entire source code for this game is huge.
                The source code for <a class = normal href = /src/content/the_mitigator.html target = _blank>The Mitigator</a> was just over 100kb,
                <a class = normal href = /src/content/snakes_and_ladders.html target = _blank>Snakes And Ladders</a> was about 200kb,
                but Io's Mission adds up to almost 1000kb.
                Of course, a lot of this figure is taken up by the sound files, but there's still a lot of hand-written code
                in there - about half of it.
                In relatable terms, this game is over half a million characters long.</p>

            <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
            <div class = demo>
                <p>∙ When making platform games, don't try to generating your
                levels purely with algorithms.</p>

                <p>∙ Make sure you think about the structure of the game before
                you begin. How do I want the actors to move? What order
                should I draw things in? What features will be useful for
                other parts of the game?</p>

                <p>∙ Make sure the main character looks good in your mind
                before adding him to your game. It's saves a lot of time.</p>

                <p>∙ Have a good idea of the gameplay before starting. What's
                the aim? How can I make it fun to play?</p>
